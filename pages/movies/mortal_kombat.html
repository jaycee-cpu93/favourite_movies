      franchise of the same name and a reboot of the Mortal Kombat film series.
      The film follows Cole Young, a washed-up mixed martial arts fighter who is

      down. Concerned for the safety of his family, he seeks out a clique of
      fighters that were chosen to defend Earthrealm against Outworld.
