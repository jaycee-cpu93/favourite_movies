      Merlin (also known as The Adventures of Merlin) is a British
      fantasy-adventure drama television programme, loosely based on the
      Arthurian legends regarding the close relations of Merlin and King Arthur.
      It has five series, The movie is about reimagining of the legend, in which
      young warlock Merlin is sent to the kingdom of Camelot by his mother
      because of his "special gift". After saving Prince Arthur's life in the
      first episode, he becomes Arthur's manservant. Merlin soon learns that the
      reason for his gift is to protect Arthur, but Merlin must hide his powers
      because magic was banned in Camelot by Arthur's father, King Uther
      Pendragon, and those caught practising it are executed. Over the years and
      after several adventures together, Merlin and Arthur become trusted
      friends and companions, with the former doing his best to influence the
      latter into becoming the king he is destined to be.
