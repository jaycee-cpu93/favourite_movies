      <p>Merlin (also known as The Adventures of Merlin) is a British
        fantasy-adventure drama television programme, loosely based on the
        Arthurian legends regarding the close relations of Merlin and King Arthur.
        It has five series, The movie is about reimagining of the legend, in which
        young warlock Merlin is sent to the kingdom of Camelot by his mother
        because of his "special gift". After saving Prince Arthur's life in the
        first episode, he becomes Arthur's manservant. Merlin soon learns that the
        reason for his gift is to protect Arthur, but Merlin must hide his powers
        because magic was banned in Camelot by Arthur's father, King Uther
        Pendragon, and those caught practising it are executed. Over the years and
        after several adventures together, Merlin and Arthur become trusted
        friends and companions, with the former doing his best to influence the
        latter into becoming the king he is destined to be.</p>
