      <p>The Pursuit of Happyness is a 2006 American biographical drama film. Life
        is a struggle for single father Chris Gardner (Will Smith). Evicted from
        their apartment, he and his young son (Jaden Christopher Syre Smith) find
        themselves alone with no place to go. Even though Chris eventually lands a
        job as an intern at a prestigious brokerage firm, the position pays no
        money. The pair must live in shelters and endure many hardships, but Chris
        refuses to give in to despair as he struggles to create a better life for
        himself and his son.</p>
